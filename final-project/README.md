Pong Project

- What program are we going to create? Use your brainstorming from the solo checkpoint to answer this question together.

We are going to create a Pong game, Pong game is a two player game, which the objective of the players are to make the boll cross the enemy (or friend) field so that a score can be made, wins who ever give up first.

- What technologies will we use? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to remind yourselves of the language, libraries and anything else you plan on using.

We are going to use the python language and also a library called “Arcade” and a random library.
We are also going to use classes and object oriented programming.

- What features will we include? The goal of asking this question is to identify what will and what won't be included. Use this simple feature planning guide to help you.

A main page: which will show a button, a start bottom.
We are also going to make different levels, which the ball would increase it’s speed, and also a bonus level.

- What is your timeline? The answer to this question is mostly already decided. Just take a minute to review the rest of the course schedule together.

Helamã: GMT -3
James: GMT +8
Nicolas: GMT -4

We are going to continue to meet as usual, the only difference is that we are going to use more github.
